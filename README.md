# C# Projects
These are some projects I created using C# and .NET Framework.

## [TwentyOne game](https://github.com/zsuzsannamangu/TTA-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/TwentyOneGame)
This is a fully functional Blackjack or Twenty One Game, but without front-end code. It also has a log built-in that records all cards that were dealt, with a timestamp. Any error message will be recorded to a database. For example, if the user enters other than a whole, positive number for their bet, an error message will be thrown, which will be recorded in the database. Once the user finishes the game, they are asked whether they want to play again. It even has functionality for calculating Aces which can be 1 or 11 according to the user's choice.

## [Newsletter subscription](https://github.com/zsuzsannamangu/TTA-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/NewsletterAppMVC)
This application was built with MVC (.NET Framework). It allows users to sign up or unsubscribe from a newsletter. All user information is recorded into a database using Entity Framework. Once users unsubscribe from the newsletter, their name won't appear in the database anymore. However, their information won't be deleted, and there will be a timestamp indicating the date they unsubscribed.

## [Car insurance quote calculator](https://github.com/zsuzsannamangu/TTA-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/CarInsurance)
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. This application was built with ASP.NET MVC Entity Framework (.NET Framework). Users are able to enter information about their car, whether they had a DUI or speeding tickets and whether they want full coverage. All this information is saved in the database and can be seen. Every time a user creates their profile, the quote is automatically calculated with business logic and displayed to the user. There is an admin page as well, where administrators can see all customer's name, email address and their associated quote.
